# Mines Auto Pause

A mod for [Stardew Valley](https://www.stardewvalley.net/) that does two things upon entering a new floor in the mines or in Skull Cavern:

1. Automatically pauses the game. (This is helpful since it prevents time from passing during the fade-in animation.)
2. Displays a notification if there is a ladder or a shaft already on the floor. (This is helpful so that you do not have to take a screenshot of the floor and then examine the screenshot before you start destroying rocks.)
