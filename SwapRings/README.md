# Swap Rings

A mod for [Stardew Valley](https://www.stardewvalley.net/) that swap rings upon pressing a hotkey.

- This mod swaps the first two rings in your inventory with the two rings that are currently equipped.
- If only one ring is in your inventory, then it will only swap out the first ring.
- If no rings are in your inventory, the hotkey will do nothing.

Currently, the hotkey is hard-coded to Z. If you want to change it, you need to recompile the mod.

This mod is [available to download at NexusMods](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/21205).
