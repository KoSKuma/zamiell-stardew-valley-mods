# WateringCanNotifier

A mod for [Stardew Valley](https://www.stardewvalley.net/) that displays a notification in-game when:

1. The watering can runs out of water. (This is helpful if you are mindlessly watering crops and not paying too close attention to your water levels.)
2. A buff wears off. (This is helpful so that you can immediately reapply the buff.)
3. Health goes below 48 or below. (48 damage is the highest amount of damage that a Royal Serpent can do, which is the highest amount of damage for enemies in the non-modified Skull Caverns.)
