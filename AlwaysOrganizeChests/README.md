# Always Organize Chests

A mod for [Stardew Valley](https://www.stardewvalley.net/) that automatically organizes chests when their contents are changed.

This mod automatically clicks on the "Organize Chest" button whenever a new item is put into a chest. This is a quality of life feature for those of us who compulsively click on the button manually all the time.

This mod is [available to download at NexusMods](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/21207).
