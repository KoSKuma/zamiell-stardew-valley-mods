# Plant Hotkey

A mod for [Stardew Valley](https://www.stardewvalley.net/) that allows planting seeds upon pressing a hotkey.

- Seeds in the first inventory slot will automatically be planted in the 9 tiles around the player.
- Fertilizer in the second inventory slot will automatically be planted in the 9 tiles around the player.

Unlike in the vanilla game, there is no cooldown on the hotkey, meaning that you can hold down the hotkey to automatically plant all of your crops optimally without having to pause the game over and over to bypass the built-in delay.

By default, the hotkey is bound to left Ctrl, but this can be changed through the [Generic Mod Config Menu](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5098) (or by editing the "config.json" file).

This mod is not yet published.

## Other Features

You can use the same hotkey in other contexts as well, affecting the 9 tiles around the player:

- Crops will be automatically harvested if they are ready.
- Trees will be automatically shaken.
- Any items that are ready will be automatically taken (e.g. from [Kegs](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Keg), [Tappers](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Tapper), and so on).
- Fruit in the first inventory slot will automatically be planted in any [Kegs](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Keg).
- Ore in the first inventory slot will automatically be planted in any [Furnaces](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Furnace).
- [Bait](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Bait) in the first inventory slot will automatically be planted in any [Crab Pots](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Crab_Pot).
