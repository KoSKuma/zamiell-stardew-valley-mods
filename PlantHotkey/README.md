# Plant Hotkey

A mod for [Stardew Valley](https://www.stardewvalley.net/) that allows planting seeds upon pressing a hotkey.

- Seeds in the first inventory slot will automatically be planted in the 9 tiles around the player.
- Fertilizer in the second inventory slot will automatically be planted in the 9 tiles around the player.

Unlike in the vanilla game, there is no cooldown on the hotkey, meaning that you can hold down the hotkey to automatically plant all of your crops optimally without having to pause the game over and over to bypass the built-in delay.

By default, the hotkey is bound to Q, but this can be changed through the [Generic Mod Config Menu](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5098) (or by editing the "config.json" file).

This mod is not yet published.
