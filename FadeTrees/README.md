# Fade Trees

A mod for [Stardew Valley](https://www.stardewvalley.net/) that automatically fades specific trees for better in-game visibility.

Currently, the mod is hard-coded to fade [Oak Trees](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Oak_Tree) that have a [Tapper](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Tapper) on them.

This mod is unpublished.
